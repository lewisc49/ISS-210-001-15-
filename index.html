                <div class="container"><p>“Sense” is a charity that raises awareness for those who are Deaf, Blind, and have other disabilities. This charity runs and operates a YouTube Channel, SenseCharity. This channel interviews families that have first hand experience with disabilities and discusses how the cost of living affects them. Recently, SenseCharity did an interview with Geordie's family; Geordie is a young boy who fights Atresia, a narrowing of a passage in the body. Families like Georgies are struggling to provide the basic necessities for their loved ones. Unfortunately, if it weren’t for their financial support to provide Geordie's feeding machine, Geordie would not be able to survive. With inflation rates at an all time high, an already disadvantaged community is feeling the effects of their financial burden now more than ever. The disabled community fights the battles of unemployment, unfair wages, and unreasonably high overall cost of living. As some disabilities prevent the ability to work traditional jobs, people are forced to rely on the government for financial support such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI). For most, the income ranges between $458 to $1,371 a month (ssa.gov). If a disabled bodied person is employed, the amount of money they receive would decrease. How can we believe it would be a livable wage for a person who may need materials such as wheelchairs, services like caregivers, or even additional medical treatments? A study conducted by The National Disability Institution states that the poverty gap between those with and without disabilities is 15% (National Disability Institution). When attempting to get a job for additional income, those with disabilities are at a disadvantage. Although the Americans Disabilities Act (ADA) is in place, it does not counteract the hardships of getting a job. For instance, if a job posting or interview is at a specific location may not be able to access the building via accessibility ramps or elevators. They might be unqualified but not to their own fault. This is because they have a lack of education due to the struggles and discrimination in schools or universities. For a community already at odds with society, the financial burden of goods and services they rely on just adds to the burden. According to the National Library of Medicine, medication costs were higher for the disabled due to the need for more prescriptions along with the lack of insurance coverage. The study finds that some are spending less money on goods like food to afford these needed prescriptions (National Library of Medicine). Other out of pocket costs come from things such as car modifications to make transportation possible. Modifications not only have hefty costs, but they also increase the cost of car insurance. Car insurance companies believe that this community is at a higher risk for accidents so their premium costs are inflated. As a country with more than 1 in 4 adults considered to be disabled, the motivation to help this community is high. The easiest way to assist in these challenges is to donate money to organizations that support families facing these financial hardships. Although that action is very helpful to end the discrimination towards the disabled bodied community, we should be thinking of more long term solutions. Employers should be aware of how accessible the application, interview, and  the job itself is. To make a governmental change, vote yes on legislation that would increase the amount of funding the disabled bodied community receives. Your vote can help eliminate discriminatory practices such as increased insurance costs. For more knowledge on how to end ableism, check out the social media links at the end of this website.

While not all disabilities are surface level, this image reveals the perceived and experienced distinction that disabled people possess in comparison to their lesser affected or unaffected peers. Although disabled people have uncontrollable limitations, they can control their future by “upskilling”. Upskilling is the practice of undergoing further educational attainment which is represented through college degrees, license, and certifications.  Upskilling is conducted when an individual feels their current employment status or compensation is unsatisfactory. With a focus on early upskilling, a comprehensive research article states: “Initial career development typically begins in late adolescence and extends through early adulthood. Developmental psychologists and career researchers often characterize this period as the “early career years.” These early years of career development are especially important in setting an overall trajectory for advancement because the biggest gains in salary and the largest advancement opportunities typically occur during the first 10 years of a career”[1]. With consideration of the aforementioned upskilling strategy, it is evident that college is one of the primary modes of career advancement. However helpful this mode is, it doesn’t come without its own set of limitations: “In the United States, young people with disabilities are about half as likely as their peers without disabilities to attend college. Approximately 30% of youth with disabilities engage in postsecondary education during the first two years after leaving high school, compared with nearly 70% of high school graduates in the general population”[1]. The lack of educational initialization and completion lends itself to disabled people working low-end jobs such as fast food, housekeeping, and janitorial work. For those who manage to pass the initial hurdles, it can be quite rewarding: “Gerber’s study of adults with learning disabilities who were highly successful in the workforce also confirms the interconnection of personal agency and vocational achievement.60 More than half of the sample in this ethnographic study completed either a Ph.D. or M.D., and 50% reported yearly incomes of over $100,000”[1]. Due to the issues associated with educational attainment and work quality of life, an organization called “Disability Action Northern Ireland is offering aid those who need it: “Our Job Match team recently held a workshop for disabled people interested in applying for NI Civil Service (NICS) Executive Officer 1 & 2 roles to inform them of the in-work support services NICS and Disability Action's Job Match and Workable NI teams can provide. The workshop focussed on the online assessments which form part of the NICS Executive Officer roles recruitment process and aimed to upskill participants to give them the confidence and knowledge to apply for these roles and progress to interview”[2]. This model of assistance is applicable across the world, not only to the country of Ireland.

The results of this study can show a general trend for other disabilities as well.

Researchers discovered that, though sick leave and disability pension were raised, annual income, education, parenthood, relationship status, and risk of depression were all negatively impacted.</p>

As said in the picture, 55% of people living with a disability struggle to pay an energy bill. The reason this picture is important is because it clearly shows the gaps using percentages from disabled people who struggle with paying their bills. A website called In Charge https://www.incharge.org/debt-relief/financial-help-disabled/  offers people with disabilities many benefits. One benefit being that it provides disabled people many counseling options like, credit counseling, housing counseling, foreclosure prevention counseling, etc. Another benefit is it helps people understand debt. In the website there are so many categories relating to the “understanding debt”, and when you click on any of them it lists a bunch of different things you should know for each topic.</p>

The chart also finds that a person is much more likely to have a higher standard of living if they are living in a household with two or more people with disabilities. This proves that those who need it the most, often have it the toughest. As mentioned throughout this site, people with disabilities have trouble maintaining their cost of living, but this also shows that the more severe the disability is, the more difficult their economic situation will be.</p>

The solid and bold lines represent the standard of living among these two groups and it is apparent that the disabled community’s standard of living is significantly lower than that of able bodied individuals even at equal incomes. The extra costs that disabled community has to pay regularly for necessities like health care, personal care, transportation, are all problems that able bodied individuals don’t have to face and this takes a large portion of their income.</p>
